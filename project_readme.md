#Grant's Contact List Application

###Project Clock
Started: 7:30 PM 

Ended: 10:40 (ish)

### Notes
*  Developed using PHPStorm. 
* More work needs to be done, such as carving up psd file to get actual css / colors from client. 
* Tested functionality in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox seems to be functioning properly.
* Assets are in sub directory named "assets" bootstrap framework was used in the interest of saving time.
* Side note: index.html is located in web directory, this is a forced habit of mine to prevent easy access to index.php (or other executable) from being executed in root dir. 
 
Thanks for the evening work gentlemen!
